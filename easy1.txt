Q1:

  It will print the full array since uniq is a non-destructive method.

Q2:

  Exclamation mark can mean "not" when used in front of a value or "=" or "<>" operators. It can also signify a destructive method which will mutate the caller.

  The question mark is used to signify a ternary statement where the conditional will result in one of two options. It can also signify a true/false result from a method when used at the end of the method name.

  1. "!=" means not equal to. It is used in a conditional statement.
  2. "!" in front of a variable creates a boolean asking whether the variable is "not true". If the variable is false, true will be returned.
  3. "!" after a method indicates it is destructive and will mutate the caller.
  4. "?" before something is used as a ternary operator for an if/else statement.
  5. "?"" after something indicates it returns a boolean (true/false)
  6. "!!" in front of a variable creates a boolean asking whether the variable is "not not true" or double-negative aside "true". If the variable isn't false or nil, true will be returned.
